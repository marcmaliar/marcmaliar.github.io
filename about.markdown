Hi, I'm Marc! I currently work at Bank of America as a software engineer in the OTC regulatory reporting division. I graduated in 2022 from the University of Chicago in Computer Science and Mathematics. I like coding in a variety of languages, but my most proficient is Python, which I used for solving heterogeneous economic models using machine learning while I was in university.

In the past, I have loved studying Vulkan, Wayland, and Arch Linux.

In my free time, I transcribe songs on my Youtube channel using my ear. I also like attending meetups for software engineers in NYC, especially ones organized by the NYC MLOps group.
