I am a recent graduate of the University of Chicago in Computer Science and Mathematics. I like coding in a variety of languages, but my most proficient is Python, which I used for solving heterogeneous economic models using deep learning.

Recently, my passion has been learning Golang for web development. In the past, I have loved studying Vulkan, Wayland, and Arch Linux.

In my free time, I transcribe songs on my Youtube channel.
