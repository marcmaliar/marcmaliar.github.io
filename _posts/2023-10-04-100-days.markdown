Starting today, October 4, I will be coding a little bit every day on topics that I enjoy.

<h1>Day 1 (Oct 4)</h1>
[Tutorial](https://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-3d-modeller.html)
<p>

Today, I started following this tutorial. I did a bit of graphics programming in university but I still find it fun and thus this was one of the first tutorials I wanted to try.
<br>

<br>
With ChatGPT's help, here are the things I learned so far: 
<ol>
  <li>Legacy OpenGL and modern OpenGL are different: the legacy one you tell OpenGL specifically the effects you want to put on the objects and in the modern one you apply shaders sequentially yourself. The modern way is harder to understand but more powerful (probably). </li>
  <li>The objects supplied to the renderer consist of shape vertices and a normal vector for where the plane is facing. </li>
  <li>Culling refers to not rendering a side of the face, usually the back side. This is for efficiency reasons. There are times you don't want to cull: for example, some effects, like transparency effects, rely on both sides to be rendered. </li>
  <li>OpenGL calls act on a global OpenGL object, not a buffer like in Vulkan. Buffers again give more power to the programmer at the cost of increased complexity. </li>
  <li>GL_DEPTH_TEST allows OpenGL to track depth values of objects and display objects in front of others. This is necessary for 3D, except when objects are transaparent. </li>

</ol> 
<br>
</p>

<h1>Day 2 (Oct 5)</h1>
Going to read a little bit of this: [Building a torrent client from scratch](https://blog.jse.li/posts/torrent/)
<p>
Here's what I learned (or am learning):
<ol>
    <li>Unlike what I assumed, torrent clients need a main central http server to get a list of peers. I thought it was fully decentralized but no. Because of this, if a torrent site goes down, I believe all the peers in those torrents are lost, which sounds like a really big issue. However, the author mentions magnet links and other actually decentralized ways of discovering peers. So they got this problem figured out. </li>
    <li>Torrent file sizes are really small (256kb-1mb) and are secured with hash, which is a great system, since it makes torrents unhackable, unless the main server which gives you the torrent file is hacked, of course. If the main server gives incorrect hashes AND gives you a list of hacked peers, then it's the end.  But if only of these problems exist, your peer will refuse to torrent.  </li>
    <li>Torrents are stored in bencode, which is a very opinionated choice because it looks hard to read. </li>
    <li>User IP addresses AND ports are shown publicly. That seems kinda scary, especially ports. Wonder if malware-ridden torrent clients can be used to hack into computers. </li>
    <li>Peers don't actually request the pieces mentioned above, they request blocks, which are a range of the bits in a piece. Multiple blocks are requested at once because network round trips are super expensive. If instead you were to ask for the blocks once by one, your client would be more than an order of magnitude slower. </li>

</ol>
</p>

<h1>Day 3 (Oct 6)</h1>

<p>
Read a little bit of various tutorials.
<ol>
    <li>I learned that discord bots must register their slash commands through Rest API.  </li>
    <li>I found a league client realtime game API, which is quite exciting. Wonder why no one has built an AI bot?</li>
    <li>Not much else just looked through various tutorials.</li>

</ol>
</p>
