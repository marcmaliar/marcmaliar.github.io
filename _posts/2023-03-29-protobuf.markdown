<h1>Making an Http JSON API for a Log Record Application</h1>
<p>
<br>Use a mutex to lock the log. Encode/decode the JSON from the request body and into the response. Put it inside internal folder. JSON is human readable and great which makes it a great choice for public-facing APIs. But internally (like between microservices) you kinda want something faster, more space efficient, checks semantics, cross-platform, versioned, types safety, backwards compatible, and more. <br>
